# ecocode.io

ecoCode is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level. The goal of the
project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative ecological
impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware", shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

This repository contains the source code of [ecocode.io](https://ecocode.io) developed with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).
Although our website has an ecological footprint, we strive to make it as light and optimized as possible. Don't
hesitate to suggest ideas and improvements on this aspect.
